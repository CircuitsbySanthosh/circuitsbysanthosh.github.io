    <h2>DIY Shoe-Integrated Foot Pressure Monitoring System</h2>
    <p class="project-year">Completed in 2025</p>

    <div class="project-card" style="margin-top:40px;">

      <h3>S – Situation</h3>
      <p>
        Diabetic patients often lose sensitivity in their feet. Continuous
        abnormal pressure goes unnoticed and can gradually lead to foot ulcers,
        which become serious if not detected early.
      </p>

      <h3 style="margin-top:30px;">T – Task</h3>
      <p>
        To design a simple, low-cost embedded system capable of continuously
        monitoring foot pressure and providing early indication of abnormal
        pressure distribution patterns.
      </p>

      <h3 style="margin-top:30px;">A – Action</h3>
      <p>
        A DIY flex sensor was embedded inside a shoe sole and connected
        to an Arduino board using jumper connections. The Arduino continuously
        read analog values from the sensor and monitored pressure variations
        in real-time. Data was observed to identify unusual pressure trends.
      </p>

      <h3 style="margin-top:30px;">R – Result</h3>
      <p>
        The system successfully demonstrated measurable pressure variation
        patterns. It validated that even a low-cost hardware prototype can
        contribute toward preventive healthcare monitoring.
