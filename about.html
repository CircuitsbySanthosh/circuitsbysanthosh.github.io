        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <div class="project-card" style="margin-bottom:40px;">
            <h3>Who I Am</h3>
            <p>
                I’m Masani Santhosh Kumar, currently pursuing B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering.
                I’m someone who is curious about how systems actually work behind the scenes — not just in theory,
                but in real hardware.
            </p>
            <p>
                What started as just a branch choice slowly turned into genuine interest.
                Working with circuits, microcontrollers, and sensors made me realize how much
                engineering goes into even the simplest everyday actions.

            <h3>How I Approach Engineering</h3>
            <p>
                I believe in learning by building. Instead of waiting to master every concept,
                I start with strong fundamentals and improve through experimentation,
                debugging, and iteration.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most of my understanding has come from building systems, making mistakes,
                and refining them until they work reliably.

            <h3>What I Work On</h3>
            <p>
                My work focuses on practical electronics systems using embedded platforms
                like Arduino. I’m especially interested in sensor-based systems,
                signal processing basics, and designing low-cost hardware solutions
                that can solve real-world problems.
