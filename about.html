      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p class="about-intro">
        Hey there, I’m <strong>Masani Santhosh Kumar</strong> — someone who always
        thinks <em>“what if?”</em> and enjoys working toward the answer.
      </p>

      <div class="about-section">
        <h3>My Journey</h3>
        <p>
          I’m currently pursuing my B.Tech second year in Electronics and
          Communication Engineering. I didn’t choose this branch because I was
          passionate about it at the beginning, but because I never wanted to be
          in the crowd.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over time, this branch slowly pulled me in and woke up my
          <strong>inner kid</strong>. Electronics started explaining things I had
          seen since childhood — how much work happens behind even the smallest
          action.
        </p>

        <p>
          Something as simple as changing a TV channel once felt instant, but
          ECE taught me how much processing, signaling, and control happens
          behind it.
        </p>

        <h3>How I Think</h3>
        <p>
          I don’t like doing random projects just for the sake of it. I want my
          work to have real-world relevance and meaning.
        </p>

        <p>
          I strongly believe that knowing the basics and then learning while
          working is better than waiting to learn everything before starting.
          My mistakes teach me more than theory ever could.
