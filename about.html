        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <div class="project-card" style="margin-bottom:40px;">
            <h3>Who I Am</h3>
            <p>
                I’m Masani Santhosh Kumar, currently pursuing B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering.
                I am focused on understanding electronic systems from a practical perspective and building
                hardware solutions that work beyond theory.
            </p>
            <p>
                My interest in electronics grew gradually through hands-on experimentation with circuits,
                microcontrollers, and sensor-based systems. I prefer learning by building and improving
                systems step by step.

            <h3>How I Approach Engineering</h3>
            <p>
                I believe strong fundamentals combined with practical implementation lead to real understanding.
                Instead of waiting to master every concept theoretically, I apply core ideas in projects
                and refine them through testing and iteration.
