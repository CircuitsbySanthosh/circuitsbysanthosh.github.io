    <h3>Who I Am</h3>
    <p>
      Hey, I’m Masani Santhosh Kumar — someone who always asks
      <strong>“what if?”</strong> and then tries to build the answer.

    <h3>My Journey</h3>
    <p>
      I’m currently pursuing my B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering.
      I didn’t choose ECE because I was passionate about it at first,
      but because I never wanted to be in the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over time, electronics woke up my <strong>inner kid</strong> and showed me
      how much engineering hides behind even the smallest everyday actions.

    <h3>How I Think</h3>
    <p>
      I believe learning while building is better than waiting to know everything.
      My mistakes teach me faster than theory ever could.
