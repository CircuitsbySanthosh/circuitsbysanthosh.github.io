    <h1>Masani Santhosh Kumar</h1>

    <p>
      Hey there, I’m Masani Santhosh Kumar — someone who always thinks
      <strong>“what if?”</strong> and enjoys working toward the answer.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m currently pursuing my B.Tech second year in Electronics and
      Communication Engineering. I didn’t choose this branch because of passion,
      but because I never wanted to be in the crowd. Over time, this branch
      slowly pulled me in and woke up my <strong>inner kid</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Microcontrollers, signals, and circuits made me realize how much work
      happens behind the smallest actions — even something as simple as
      changing a TV channel.
    </p>

    <p>
      I prefer building meaningful, real-world projects and learning while
      working, because my mistakes teach me more than theory alone.
    </p>
